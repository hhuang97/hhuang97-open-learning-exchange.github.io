Hello! I'm a sophomore majoring in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I really enjoy working on
personal projects, and you can find some of them on my own github account. Of all the fields in computer science, the one that
fascinates me the most is artificial intelligence - which is also (arguably) the future of humanity. Some of my past experiences
include working on a role-playing game in Python OpenGL, a terminal-based, Turing-complete programming language based on Lisp,
and research in natural-language processing (NLP).

I look forward to working with all of you!
